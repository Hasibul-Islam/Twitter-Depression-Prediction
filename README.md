# Twitter Depression Prediction
In this project I have tried to cluster and predict whether a twitter post is negative or positive. I have used dataset from [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/kazanova/sentiment140). The used models are,

1. Xboost (Ensemble Statistical model)
2. RandomForest (Ensemble Statistical model)
3. LogisticRegression (Ensemble Statistical model)
4. ANN (Deep Learning model)
